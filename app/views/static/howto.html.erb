        <h3 class='overview_title'>What is Global Forest Watch?</h3>
        <p>Global Forest Watch (GFW) is a <%= link_to 'partnership', about_path %> convened by the World Resources Institute that mobilizes satellite technology, open data, and human networks to monitor forests in near real-time and promote better forest management. The GFW website aims to provide current, reliable, and actionable information about what is happening in forests around the world. GFW adheres to an <a href='https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw'>open source</a> and <%= link_to 'open data', sources_path %> policy, providing access to data that are free for everyone. GFW is intended for use by governments, companies, NGOs, researchers, communities, and others seeking to better manage forests and improve local livelihoods.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Who can use it?</h3>
        <p>GFW aims to radically improve the availability, quality, and accessibility of forest data for everyone:</p>

        <ul class='bullets'>
          <li><strong>Governments</strong> can use GFW to detect illegal forest clearing and target forest law enforcement efforts.</li>
          <li><strong>Companies</strong> can monitor the impacts of commodity supply chains on forests and demonstrate compliance with sustainability commitments and certifications.</li>
          <li><strong>NGOs</strong> can identify deforestation hotspots and bolster their investigations, advocacy, and campaigns.</li>
          <li><strong>Indigenous communities</strong> can monitor their territories and raise an alarm when their customary forests are threatened.</li>
          <li><strong>Media</strong> can gather evidence, data, and graphics for reporting.</li>
          <li><strong>Researchers</strong> can analyze forest trends on a local or global scale and better understand the causes of forest change.</li>
          <li><strong>Concerned citizens everywhere</strong> can learn more about the state of forests and participate in forest monitoring. Students and educators can learn more about forests at local and global scales.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>GFW also brings together a dynamic community of partners with expertise in forest science, conservation, supply chain management, web development, citizen science, community outreach, and in-depth knowledge of priority forests around the world.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Who is behind Global Forest Watch?</h3>
        <p>GFW is supported by a diversity of partners that contribute data, technical capabilities, funding, and expertise. The partnership is convened by the World Resources Institute. Visit the <%= link_to 'GFW about page', about_path %> for a full list of partners.</p>

        <p>Interested in joining the GFW partnership? E-mail us <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.com'>here</a>.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Why do forests matter?</h3>
        <p>Human society and the global economy are inextricably linked to forests. More than 1 billion people depend on forests for their livelihoods. Forest ecosystems also play a critical role in stabilizing the climate; providing food, water, wood products, and vital medicines; and supporting much of the world’s biodiversity.</p>

        <p>Despite recent efforts to combat harmful deforestation in some regions, forest ecosystems are still under threat. According to <a href='http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/forest-and-landscape-restoration' target='_blank'>WRI research</a>, 30% of potential global forest cover has been cleared, while another 20% has been degraded. Most remaining forests have been fragmented, leaving only about 15% of original forest cover intact.</p>

        <p>Balancing the demand for natural resources with the need to preserve vital ecosystems requires robust data to help resource managers make good decisions. GFW can help by providing this information at a global scale.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>How do I use Global Forest Watch?</h3>

    <article id='terminology'>
      <h2 class='source_category_title'>Terminology</h2>

      <div class='source_body'>
        <h3 class='overview_title'>How does Global Forest Watch define “forest”?</h3>
        <p>Various definitions exist for the term “forest,” and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus definition. The various data sets hosted on GFW may define “forest” differently or pertain to different types of forest. Through the information on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>, we aim to be transparent about the assumptions and definitions feeding into each data set.</p>

        <p>See the next entry for GFW’s approach to tree plantations versus natural forests.</p>

        <p>Here are key examples of how a few GFW-hosted data sets define “forest”:</p>

        <ul class='bullets'>
          <li>The UMD Tree Cover Loss and Gain data sets define “forest” based on <a href='http://glcf.umd.edu/data/vcf/' target='_blank'>MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields</a>. “Forest” is further defined as areas where canopy cover exceeds 25%, with vegetation more than 5 meters tall.</li>

          <li>FORMA alerts apply to areas considered “forest” within the humid tropical forest biome, as defined by <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/105/27/9439.ful' target='_blank'>Hansen et al.(2008)</a>, based on <a href='http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf' target='_blank'>WWF’s terrestrial ecoregions</a>. This layer, a composite of forest ecoregions, is available for viewing or downloading on <a href='http://wri-01.cartodb.com/tables/ecoregions_biome/public' target='_blank'>CartoDB</a>.</li>

          <li><a href='http://www.intactforests.org/' target='_blank'>Intact Forest Landscapes</a> (IFL) are defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within the zone of current forest extent, showing no signs of significant human activity and large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. Although all IFL are within the forest zone, some may contain extensive naturally treeless areas, including grasslands, wetlands, lakes, alpine areas, and ice. Read more <a href='http://www.intactforests.org/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In our general writing, including the GFW blog, “forest” refers to a landscape with a high density of trees and value for biodiversity, carbon storage, and human use.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Do you distinguish tree plantations from natural forests?</h3>
        <p>As noted above, the various data sets hosted on GFW may define “forest” differently.</p>

        <p>Tree plantations are not distinguished from natural forests in the case of several key data sets hosted on GFW (including 2000 Forest Cover Extent, UMD tree cover loss and gain, FORMA alerts, and QUICC alerts). Tree cover loss may include cases of plantation forests being harvested, and tree cover gain may include cases where natural forests are replaced with tree plantations.</p>

        <p>It is nonetheless important to <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/805.full' target='_blank'>distinguish</a> between natural forests and tree plantations when considering conservation value, carbon storage, and value to local communities. Natural forests have higher biodiversity, store more carbon, and are more often associated with the traditional livelihoods of forest-dependent communities.</p>

        <p>Global Forest Watch users may be able to use contextual data such as concession boundaries, protected areas, and satellite imagery base maps  to help distinguish tree plantation from natural forests. Users are also encouraged to compare data available on GFW to other data sets that may help distinguish plantations from natural forests. GFW and partners are also currently developing a “plantation forests map” for the tropical regions to determine the location of plantations on a near-global scale. The map, developed through remote sensing methods, will be coming soon to the GFW site.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>How do you define “deforestation” and related terms (e.g., “forest loss,” “forest clearing,” “tree cover loss,” and “tree cover loss alerts”?)</h3>

        <p>The various data sets hosted on GFW have different terminology for types of forest change and may define these terms differently. GFW does not aim to provide a consensus definition. See our <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %> for more detail.</p>

        <p>In general writing, GFW uses “forest loss,” “forest clearing,” “forest cover loss,” “forest degradation,” and similar terms to refer to the removal of a significant number of trees from a landscape. This can be the result of human use of forest landscapes or natural events. These terms are generally “gross,” not “net,” as they do not take into account regrowth of forests.</p>

        <p>Note: We generally do not use the term “deforestation” in order to avoid confusion with technical usages of this word by different sectors.</p>

        <p>Data sets such as FORMA alerts, QUICC alerts, MODIS fire alerts, and SAD alerts are “forest cover loss alerts.”</p>

        <p>Here are key examples of how a few GFW-hosted data sets define these terms:</p>

        <ul class='bullets'>
          <li>The UMD Tree Cover Loss data sets define “tree cover loss” as stand replacement disturbance, or the death of living trees within a 30 meter × 30 meter area. This definition only applies to areas where canopy cover exceeds 25%, with vegetation more than 5 meters tall.</li>

          <li>FORMA alerts indicate areas of 500 meters × 500 meters where there is a high probability of tree cover loss. It is important to note that this alert-based system is not the same as an area measurement of tree cover loss.</li>

          <li>QUICC alerts measure significant changes in green vegetation cover.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For more information on each data set, please visit our <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Do GFW data reveal the quality of forest management (e.g., sustainable vs. unsustainable)? What about forest change from natural versus human causes?</h3>
        <p>GFW forest change data (such as UMD tree cover loss and FORMA alerts) do not necessarily distinguish the quality of the forest management (e.g., sustainable or unsustainable), the legality (illegal or legal), or the cause (e.g., natural or human) of forest change events. For example, the forest change data available on GFW will include forest change from tree harvesting, fires, pests, and forest clearing for agriculture.</p>

        <p>However, contextual data available on GFW can help users draw more informed conclusions about the nature and drivers of forest change events. For example, users can overlay forest change data over the protected areas layer to flag areas of potential concern. Or users can pull up satellite imagery base maps to look for “burnscars,” “blowdowns,” logging roads, and so on.</p>

      <h2 class='source_category_title'>Data</h2>

      <div class='source_body'>
        <h3 class='overview_title'>What kinds of data are available on Global Forest Watch?</h3>
        <p>GFW seeks to bring together the most current, reliable, and robust data to monitor forest change around the world. GFW incorporates and integrates a wide range of data sets that can be overlaid and compared, including:</p>

        <ul clasS='bullets'>
          <li><strong>Forest change data</strong>, such as global forest change data from the University of Maryland, near real-time FORMA alerts for the humid tropics, SAD alerts for the Brazilian Amazon from Imazon, quarterly vegetation change data from NASA, and others</li>
          <li><strong>Forest cover data</strong>, including the extent of forest land in 2000, Intact Forest Landscapes, and pantropical carbon density</li>
          <li><strong>Forest use data</strong>, which includes contextual information, such as concession areas for natural resource extraction or agricultural production</li>
          <li><strong>Conservation data</strong>, such as global boundaries for protected areas, biogeographical data on threatened species, and biodiversity hotspots</li>
          <li><strong>Qualitative and anecdotal data</strong>, such as user-submitted stories (submit one <%= link_to 'here', new_story_path %>)</li>
          <li><strong>People data</strong>, including community land boundaries and land tenure rights (coming soon)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By monitoring changes tracked by these data sets over time, users can better understand drivers and patterns of forest loss worldwide.</p>

        <p>See our <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %> for more detail. To contribute or suggest data, please <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.com'>email</a> us.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Where do the data come from?</h3>
        <p>The data on GFW come from various sources. Most of the data are in the public domain and have been developed by governments, NGOs, research institutions, or companies. Note that the data come in different formats and vary in their accuracy, timeliness, and geographical extent. See GFW’s <%= link_to 'Data policy', sources_path %> for more details.</p>

        <p>Some data are produced directly by WRI and our partners, such as FORMA alerts, Intact Forest Landscapes, and some forest use data.</p>

        <p>For more details, see the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Do you have these data sets available for every country?</h3>
        <p>GFW aims to provide data with global coverage, but this isn’t always possible. The geographic coverage of each data set is described on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

        <p>Data may have limited coverage for various reasons. GFW works to incorporate new data as quickly as possible as they are made available. If you know of a publicly available data set that we do not have, please <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.com'>contact us</a> to let us know.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>How accurate are the data displayed on Global Forest Watch?</h3>
        <p>The accuracy of the data displayed on GFW is variable. Methodologies and cautions for specific data sets are available on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

        <p>GFW strives to include only the most accurate data whenever possible and to make the user aware of the risk of inaccuracies in the data. GFW is not responsible for data from other sources. See more about GFW’s approach to data in our <%= link_to 'Data policy', sources_path %>.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>Why do different data layers contradict each other or not overlap exactly?</h3>
        <p>Different data sets measure different things and are derived using different methodologies. Such differences can lead to results that may manifest as contradictory layers on the GFW platform. In some cases, a lack of available high-quality data may cause a greater margin of error for certain data sets.</p>

        <p></p>

        <ul class='bullets'>
          <li><strong>Protected areas vs. the grayscale base map:</strong> The boundaries for protected areas on the Google grayscale base map do not always align with the protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). In this case, the WDPA data set only includes official protected areas—defined regions formally protected by law at the national level—whereas the base map includes recreational areas and other informal green spaces. Furthermore, the WDPA data is approved and reported by individual countries, while Google’s base map is composed of data from a variety of sources. Therefore, the base map grayscale network of parks and protected areas is more expansive (and less defined) than that of the protected areas layer, causing visible incongruities between the two data sets.</li>

          <li><p><strong>Intact Forest Landscapes vs. tree cover extent:</strong> These data sets measure different things. Tree cover extent shows all 30 X 30 meter areas that meet a minimum threshold of tree cover, whereas Intact Forest Landscapes only show forests that show no significant signs of human activity (see the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %> for specifics).</p>

          <p>Users may find instances where tree cover extent does not fall within the boundaries of Intact Forest Landscapes. This is because the Intact Forest Landscapes layer is based on MODIS (250 meter resolution satellite imagery), which is known to overestimate low tree cover densities, whereas the tree cover extent layer is based on Landsat (30 meter resolution satellite imagery).  As a result, the tree cover extent layer may not show tree cover in an area that is covered by an intact forest landscape polygon.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>I am familiar with a particular geographic area and believe your data set is inaccurate. What can I do?</h3>
        <p>First, please make sure you understand the differences in the data layers and their respective methodologies.</p>

         <p>If you still believe our data are inaccurate, please <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.com'>contact us</a> with a brief description of the location, data set in question, and observed issue. You can also <%= link_to 'submit a story', new_story_path %>, with photos or other details. Our team will flag the area for further investigation.</p>

        <h3 class='overview_title'>How do I cite Global Forest Watch as a data source?</h3>
        <p>Each data set has an individual citation, which can be found on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>. If you are referencing the source website or publication for a data set, please use the “Citation.”  If you are referencing a figure or number generated by GFW or data downloaded from the GFW website, please use the “Suggested citation for data as displayed on GFW.”  For data that are displayed in their original form or when users are directed to the original source to download data, a suggested citation is not listed.</p>

      <h2 class='source_category_title'>Global Forest Watch for Businesses</h2>

      <div class='source_body'>
        <p>Almost every business depends on forests in some way. As a buyer of commodities, you can face risks if you don’t know how your supply chain depends on or affects forest resources. As a seller of commodities, you may risk losing customers if you can’t demonstrate that your products are deforestation-free.</p>

        <p><%= link_to 'Global Forest Watch (GFW)', about_path %> provides information and analysis to help you avoid these risks and be a better steward of forests.</p>

        <p>GFW is now open for beta testing to users around the world who want to see what is happening in forests in near-real-time. Building on the core data platform, we are now engaging interested companies to develop specialized features and services geared for business users. We envision this platform enabling business users to:</p>

        <ul class='bullets'>
          <li>Communicate with customers about deforestation-free commodity production</li>

          <li>Verify that commodity suppliers are in compliance with deforestation-free sourcing policies</li>

          <li>Identify issues as they happen</li>

          <li>Evaluate and demonstrate compliance with sustainability certification standards</li>

          <li>Assess supply chain risks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Over the coming year, GFW will develop these features together with a core group of corporate partners committed to supply chain transparency and ending commodity-driven deforestation. We’ll also establish a working group of interested companies we’ll invite to test the site as it is developed and provide feedback.</p>

        <p>For more information or to join the conversation, contact: <strong>Elizabeth Baer</strong>, <em>Corporate Engagement Manager for Global Forest Watch, World Resources Institute</em> (<a href='mailto:ebaer@wri.org'>ebaer@wri.org</a>, +1 (202) 729-7818).</p>
